        <h3>FootData Predictive Interface</h3>
        <p class="category">Machine Learning</p>
        <p class="description">My project integrates data acquisition via web scraping, data manipulation, and preprocessing for predictive modeling, and Streamlit deployment for user interaction. Through scraping Transfermarkt and FIFA Stats, I gather data. Then, I preprocess it, laying the foundation for predictive modeling. Lastly, I deploy My model using Streamlit, enabling interactive feature adjustment and fee prediction for an intuitive user experience..</p>

        <h3>NasdaqPredictor</h3>
        <p class="category">Machine Learning</p>
        <p class="description">I am currently working on a project to develop a model capable of predicting closing price movements for hundreds of stocks listed on Nasdaq. This challenge involves utilizing data from the order book and auction closing prices of the stock. Auction information can be exploited to adjust prices, assess supply and demand dynamics, and identify trading opportunities.</p>
